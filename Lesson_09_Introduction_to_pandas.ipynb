        "\n",
        "As we have become familiar with the NumPy library we've discovered that it makes working with data easier. Because we can easily work across multiple dimensions, our code is a lot easier to understand. By using vectorized operations instead of loops, our code will be faster with larger data.\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy provides fundamental structures and tools that makes working with data easier, but there are several things that limit it usefulness as a single tool when working with data:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The lack of support for column names forces us to frame the questions we want to answer as multi-dimensional array operations.\n",
        "- Support for only one data type per ndarray makes it more difficult to work with data that contains both numeric and string data.\n",
        "- There are lots of low level methods, however there are many common analysis patterns that don't have pre-built methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **pandas** library provides solutions to all of these pain points and more. Pandas is not so much a replacement for NumPy as an extension of NumPy. The underlying code for pandas uses the NumPy library extensively, which means the concepts you've been learning will come in handy as you begin to learn more about pandas.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this mission, we'll learn:\n",
        "\n",
        "- about the two core pandas types: dataframes and series\n",
        "- how to select data using row and column labels\n",
        "- a variety of methods for exploring data with pandas\n",
        "- how to assign data using various techniques in pandas\n",
        "- how to use boolean indexing with pandas for selection and assignment\n",

        "We'll be working with data set from [Fortune](http://fortune.com/) magazine's [Global 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_Global_500) list 2017, which ranks the top 500 corporations worldwide by revenue. The dataset we'll be using was originally compiled [here](https://data.world/chasewillden/fortune-500-companies-2017), however we have modified the original data set into a more accessible format.\n",

        "- **revenue_change** - The percentage change in revenue between the current and prior fiscal years.\n",
        "- **profits** - Net income for the fiscal year, in millions of dollars (USD).\n",
        "- **ceo** - The company's Chief Executive Officer.\n",
        "- **industry** - The industry in which the company operates.\n",
        "- **sector** - The sector in which the company operates.\n",
        "- **previous_rank** - The Global 500 rank for the company for the prior year.\n",
        "- **country** - The Country in which the company is headquartered.\n",
        "- **hq_location** - The City and Country, (or City and State for the USA) where the company is headquarted.\n",

        "import pandas as pd\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",

        "We're starting to get a feel for how axes labels in pandas make selecting data much easier. Pandas also has a large number of methods and functions that make working with data easier. Let's use a few of these to explore our Fortune 500 data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first method we'll learn about is the [Series.describe()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.describe.html#pandas.Series.describe) method, which returns some descriptive statistics on the data contained within a specific pandas series. Let's look at an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "revs = f500[\"revenues\"]\n",
        "print(revs.describe())\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "count       500.000000\n",
        "mean      55416.358000\n",
        "std       45725.478963\n",
        "min       21609.000000\n",
        "25%       29003.000000\n",
        "50%       40236.000000\n",

        "max      485873.000000\n",
        "Name: revenues, dtype: float64\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "We've assigned the **revenues** column to a new series, **revs**, and then used the **describe()** method on that series. The method tells us how many non-null values are contained in the series, the mean and standard devation, along with the minimum, maximum and [quartile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile) values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rather than assigning the series to it's own variable, we can actually skip that step and use the method directly on the result of the column selection. This is called **method chaining** and is a way to combine multiple methods together in a single line. It's not unique to pandas, however it is something that you see a lot in pandas code. Let's see what the command looks like with method chaining, using the **assets** column.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",

        "Name: assets, dtype: float64\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "From here, you'll start to see method chaining used more in our missions. When writing code, you should always assess whether method chaining will make your code harder to read. It's always preferable to break out into more than one line if it will make your code easier to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "You might have noticed that the values in the code segment above look a little bit different. Because the values for this column are too long to display neatly, pandas has displayed them in **E-notation**, a type of [scientific notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation). Here is an expansion of what the E-notation represents:\n",

        "Name: country, dtype: object\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is what the output indicates:\n",
        "\n",
        "The first statistic, **count**, is the same as for numeric columns, showing us the number of non-null values. The other three statistics are new:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **unique** - The number of unique values in the series. In this case, it tells us that there are 34 different countries represented in the Fortune 500.\n",
        "- **top** - The most common value in the series. The USA is the most common country that a company in the Fortune 500 is headquartered in.\n",
        "- **freq** - The frequency of the most common value. The USA is the country that 132 companies from Fortune 500 are headquartered in.\n",
        "\n",
        "Because series' and dataframes are two distinct objects, they have their own unique methods. There are many times where both series and dataframe objects have a method of the same name that behaves in similar ways. DataFrame objects also have a [DataFrame.describe()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.describe.html) method that returns these same statistics for every column. If you like, you can take a look at the documentation using the link in the previous sentence to familiarize yourself with some of the differences between the two methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "One difference is that you need to specify manually if you want to see the statistics for the non-numeric columns. By default, **DataFrame.describe()** will return statistics for only numeric columns. If we wanted to get just the object columns, we need to use the **include=['O']** parameter when using the dataframe version of describe:\n",

        "\n",
        "First, we create a boolean series by comparing the values in the sector column to **'Motor Vehicles & Parts'**.\n",

The reason behind this is that pandas uses the NumPy integer dtype, which does not support NaN values. Pandas inherits this behavior, and in instances where you try and assign a NaN value to an integer column, pandas will silently convert that column to a float dtype. If you're interested in finding out more about this, [there is a specific section on integer NaN values in the pandas documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/gotchas.html#nan-integer-na-values-and-na-type-promotions).\n",
