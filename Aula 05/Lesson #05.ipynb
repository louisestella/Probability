In an industry laden with illegal downloading, Ek and Lorenson set out to create a service that reduce piracy and also generate profits for labels and musicians. That service, is called [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/).\n","\n","Spotify is a subscription-based music streaming service that gives users access to millions of songs and content from artists around the world. Users around the world pay a monthly subscription fee and have unlimited access to the music on Spotify. As of January 2018, Spotify has over 70 million paying users.

An artist who has made the top 100 list on Spotify has likely reached the upper echelon's of music success. In this mission, to better understand the qualities of successful tracks on spotify, we'll be answering two questions:\n","\n","- **What are the average total streams for each song in the top 100?**\n","- **Which song was the most popular song of 2017?**\n","\n","\n","To answer this question, we'll use the [Spotify's WorldWide Daily Song Ranking](https://www.kaggle.com/edumucelli/spotifys-worldwide-daily-song-ranking), to analyze the popular songs of 2017-2018:\n","\n","\n","| |Track Name | Artist | Position | Streams |  |\n","|------------|--------------------------|---------------|---------|------------|\n","| 77 | Sign of the Times | Harry Styles | 756325 | 503894417 |\n","| 92 | Photograph | Ed Sheeran | 1525708 | 441132246 |\n","| 70 | Look What You Made Me Do | Taylor Swift | 335837 | 562562226 |\n","| 36 | Scared to Be Lonely | Martin Garrix | 1074560 | 866104216 |\n","| 13 | Attention | Charlie Puth | 560536 | 1112777364 |\n","\n","\n","Before we read in the full data, let's start by writing a function that calculates the average value in the streams column for just these 5 songs.\n","\n","\n","**Exercise**\n","\n","<img width=\"100\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1E8tR7B9YYUXsU_rddJAyq0FrM0MSelxZ\">\n","\n","1.

Rather than writing our own implementation every time, luckily, someone else has likely already written an implementation as a **module**.\n","\n","A module is a collection of functions and variables that have been bundled together in a single file. This single file, is generally centered around a specific theme. There are modules that focus on [math](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) operations, audio files ([audioop](https://docs.python.org/3/library/audioop.html)), image processing ([pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) and many more.\n","\n","Modules improve the readability of our code by abstracting away the implementation while allowing us to understand exactly what the code does. Let's take an example of **sum()**:\n","\n","```python\n","l = [66,44,22]\n","sum(l)\n","```\n","\n","Here, we can't see the code underneath the **sum()**. However, we know exactly what the code does in one line.\n","\n","To load a module, we'll use the **import** statement. For readability, it's usually a good idea to import the modules we'll need in the beginning of our script.\n","\n","\n","When importing a module, we then get access to all the functions and variables within the module. Let's look at a sample implementation of two functions: **sum()** and **exp()**.\n","\n","```python\n","def total(input):\n","    total = 0\n","    for num in input:\n","        total += num\n","    return total\n","\n","def exp(input):\n","    return 2.718281**input\n","```\n","\n","Rather than write our own implementation, we could use the functions in just two lines of code. Whenever we use a module, we don't need to know how the code is implemented to use it:\n","\n","<img width=\"600\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1wcsD7YADFPoqEAhjT2UiiI8c-rfz5Df7\">\n","\n","To use a specific function within our math module, we'll use the dot notation followed by the name of the function:\n","\n","```python\n","module.function()\n","```\n","\n","Returning to our earlier example **sum()** is a built-in function:\n","\n","```python\n","l = [66,44,22]\n","sum(l)\n","```\n","\n","There's no need to call a specific module to access the function. Here are the list of all the [built-ins](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html).\n","\n","Popular Python modules have documentation describing the names of the functions and variables we could use within the module. Generally, whenever you use a module, it's good practice to reference the documentation. In this mission, we'll be using the [statistics](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html) and [math](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) modules. Well documented modules allows us to re-use the implementation without needing to understand the code ourselves.\n","\n","As a review of everything covered on this section: \n","- Use **import** to load a module. Load modules in the beginning of a script. \n","- To use a function within a module, remember **module.function()**. \n","- When using a [built-ins](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) function, you do not need to add the module name in front the function.\n","\n","\n","\n","**Exercise**\n","\n","<img width=\"100\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1E8tR7B9YYUXsU_rddJAyq0FrM0MSelxZ\">\n","\n","\n","1.

Although this gives us useful information, we'd like incorporate more data to better gauge the average streams for the top songs on Spotify.\n","\n","To incorporate more data, we'll need to load a CSV file containing the top 100 songs on Spotify. In the previous course, we learned how to work with CSV files by:\n","\n","- Opening a file\n","- Reading the contents of that file into a string\n","- Splitting the string on the newline character\n","- Splitting each line on the comma character\n","\n","Now that we understand how modules work, there is a **csv** module. This module has a function called **reader()** which takes a file object as an argument and returns an object that represents our data. We'll cover objects later in this course, but for now, we'll convert the object to a list and use the result.\n","\n","To read data from a file called **\"sample.csv\"**, we first import the csv module:\n","\n","```python\n","import csv\n","```\n","\n","Next, we open the file:\n","\n","```python\n","f = open(\"sample.csv\", \"r\")\n","```\n","\n","\"r\" stands for read-only mode.
